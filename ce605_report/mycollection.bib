abstract = {The thesis explores the concept of casting large span, anticlastic concrete shell struc- tures with the aid of a flexible formwork, specifically a prestressed cable-net and/or fabric formwork. Such a system consists of lightweight, inexpensive and widely available cables and fabrics, requires little to no falsework, allowing for unobstructed access underneath, and does not rely on skilled labour nor on the use of release agents for demoulding.},
