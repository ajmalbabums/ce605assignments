Show that the sum of two independent identically distributed exponential random variables results a gamma distribution.

Let X and Y be two independent identically distributed exponential random variables with $\lambda=0.15$
Let Z = X + Y;
Find the pdf of Z, and obtain its parameters by independently generating 1000 values for X and Y
